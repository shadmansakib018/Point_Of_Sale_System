# Point_Of_Sale_System (POS)
## In the POS system firstly there will be a login page for the cashier  which will be accessed with a username and a password. The login page directly takes us to the main menu where all the functionalities takes place. These include addition, deletion and update of various product information (Inventory Management). When a customer has finished purchasing various products, all of them are added to the cart and a total amount and a hardcopy of the receipt is generated.
## The system was designed according to an incremental model. Incremental Model is a process of software development where requirements are broken down into multiple standalone modules of software development cycle. Therefore,the development was done in steps from analysis design, implementation, testing/verification, maintenance. Each iteration passed through the requirements, design, coding and testing phases. And each subsequent release of the system adds function to the previous release until all designed functionality.
